            <em>Be wary of unproductive work</em>
            <p>Currently in NS, not much chance to do deep work in camp. I feel fairly productive working on SOP, because it has tractable progress.
                But a lot of the work is to be a human router, pulling info from different places and packaging them. 
                There are quite a lot of unproductive work to be done: printing attestation letters, compiling info etc. But these involve 
                interactions and building rapport with other ppl in the SQN. plus, i'm not in a career, and don't have to worry much about KPI etc

            <em>Prioritizing tasks and boundaries</em>
            <p>
                Figure out what gets most talked about, see what successful ppl are doing to understand 
                how to prioritize. You teach people how to treat you. it's ok to set boundaries and expectations.
                Outsourcing and delegating
