            Did a Bachelor's in Mechanical Engineering, specialising in Robotics and Mechatronics. I had no idea what engineering was before enrolling.
            In the first year of NS I just heard someone took it and thought "yeah maybe that?", and got shipped off to study afterwards lol. 
            But i found MechE to be an interesting and versatile discipline, and quite enjoyed it.

                    LDP was a constant during my time in NTU. It was a creative space for me to test out random ideas
                    for community outreach and engagement. Some of the things we did were:

            The 2 short years in NJC changed my life. It was a safe space to learn and fail, and try again. NJC was not the best school, but i believe
            it was the best school for me. So grateful for my time there: the cheap caifan, chilling with stanley at the benches before assembly, 
            being the VIA rep for 16SH13 w Zhi Heng, going for YLTC, mugging for exams, crashing table tennis sessions, meeting yy.

            These are the days that must happen to us, and there is no way getting back to where the laws of time and space expelled me from.
            But I'll carry the memories whereever i go, and am so glad i was there. I was. The rare statement that, once it becomes true, never stops.
